This app monitors the [Binance](https://www.binance.com) cryptocurrency exchange in search of triangle arbitrage opportunities.

## The HUD

The HUD is the chart displayed above. It is repainted after each calculation cycle to show snapshots of currently detected
arbitrage opportunities. To disable the HUD, set `HUD.ENABLED` to false.

### Reading the HUD

- **Trade** - Three symbols related by exchange rates that are involved in the triangle arbitrage.
- **Profit** - Percent profit or loss from executing the triangle arbitrage. This includes trading fees specified via `TRADING.TAKER_FEE` config.
- **AB Age** - Time in seconds since the most recent update of the market ticker relating the first and second symbols in the arbitrage.
- **BC Age** - Time in seconds since the most recent update of the market ticker relating the second and third symbols in the arbitrage.
- **CA Age** - Time in seconds since the most recent update of the market ticker relating the third and first symbols in the arbitrage.
- **Age** - Time in seconds since the least recently updated market ticker involved in the triangle arbitrage.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Install Prerequisites

The following dependencies are recommended to run an instance:

1. **NodeJS** - 11.10.0
2. **Npm** - 6.10.0

### Obtain the Codebase

- Clone from github
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/bmino/binance-triangle-arbitrage.git
  ```
- Download a zip of the [latest release](https://github.com/bmino/binance-triangle-arbitrage/releases/latest)

### Configuration

All configuration is done inside the `/config` directory.
To setup your configuration for the first time, duplicate the `config.json.example` file and remove the ".example" extension.
This process must be done before deploying the app for the first time and redone after each major version update where the configuration has changed.
Explanations of each value can be found [here](config/readme.md).

### Assumptions

1. All fees are [paid via BNB balance](https://binance.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000583311)
2. Sufficient quantity of BNB is maintained during the runtime of the bot

### Deployment

#### On Docker container (faster, no messing with host environment)

1. Pull the official image

```
docker pull gabrielmilan/binance-triangle-arbitrage
```

2. Run it by mounting your configuration file into it

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/config.json:/code/bot/config/config.json gabrielmilan/binance-triangle-arbitrage
```

#### On host machine

1. Install project dependencies

   ```
   cd binance-triangle-arbitrage
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the application
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Execution strategies

There are two supported methods of executing an identified triangle arbitrage opportunity. More details [here](src/resources/docs/strategies.md)

- **Linear** - Three trades are executed sequentially with each being initiated after the previous has completed
- **Parallel** - Three trades are executed asynchronously with each being initiated at the same time

## Logging

All logs are stored in the `/logs` directory. The log level is set via the `LOG.LEVEL` configuration property.

- **performance.log** - Data about performance and speed
- **execution.log** - Market interactions and profits
